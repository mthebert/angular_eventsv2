# Angular Event Application

This project is a sample [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app by [Matt Thebert](mailto:matt@thebert.com) which will be a simple event calendar.

Some decisions being made on top of AngularJS are:

## Angular-Seed

I am using the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) as a base for the project.  It is a nice starting point for an AngularJS app.  Version 1.2.6 is where I'm jumping in.

## Bootstrap

Why reinvent the wheel for CSS when you can add some quick styling to your app?  I still haven't made the leap to v3, so I'll stick to [v2.3.2](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/)


## JQuery

Angular can do a lot with the DOM, but you still can always get some help with [JQuery](http://jquery.com).

## Underscore.JS

I will also be using [Underscore.JS](http://underscorejs.org/) for some additional JS help.

## Node.JS

For serving up my web app, I'll be using [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) while I develop locally.

## JSON

OK, this isn't really necessary but for now the decision is instead of having a "real" data store, I'll be using JSON text files to store my data locally.  In my TODO I have made note that I will change this once the first phase of development is done.  But I suppose this is an infrastructure decision worth noting for now.

### To DO:
There will be some testing to come, an actual data store of some sort to replace the JSON, and maybe we will push this to the cloud.

-Better validation on the new events form
-use filter to display an icon for the session level

### PluralSight

At the center of all this, I will be creating this app while trying to add to my AngularJS knowledge by going through the [PluralSight course on Angular Fundamentals](http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/angularjs-fundamentals)
